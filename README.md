- Hi, I’m @mickeygard
-  I’m interested in becoming a developer so I can create solutions for money. I have about a year until I try to enter the tech industry, so I need to learn fast, but I think it's well within the realm of possibility.
-  I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and Java, soon to be followed by Python. I intend to start projects as soon as I have each knowledge base so I can lean as fast as possible.
-  I’m not looking to collaborate yet, but Im always open to ideas.
-  How to reach me: mickey_gardner@hotmail.com (I'm very old. Keeping the same email, like keeping a phone#, helps me not lose people over the years.)
