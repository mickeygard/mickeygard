- Hi, I’m @mickeygard
- I'm a new developer learning skills so I can get paid to create solutions for other people's problems. I'll be looking for full remote jobs, or job in the Denver area in about summer/fall of 2024. I have about a year until I retire from my first career and enter the tech industry so I'm learning fast and adjusting my goals as I learn more.
-  I’m starting out with HTML, CSS, and Java through Codecademy's Front End Developer career path, probably followed by Python. I'm starting projects as soon as I have each knowledge base to solidify what I learn as fast as possible.
-  I’m not looking to collaborate yet, but Im always open to ideas.
-  How to reach me: mickey_gardner@hotmail.com (Keeping the same email, like keeping a phone#, helps me not lose people over the years.)
